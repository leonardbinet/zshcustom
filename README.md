# Overview
Those zsh configuration files are intended to be placed in $ZSH_CUSTOM directory.

## Prerequisite
Installed zsh, and oh-my-zsh.

## Secrets
Secrets themselves aren't versionned, instead a template is versionned to remember which environment variables might be expected.
Just `cp secrets.zsh.dist secrets.zsh` and edit it afterwards.
